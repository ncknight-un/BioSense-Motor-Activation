# BioSense-Motor-Activation
Code and Project Description for Bio sensory motor activation. 

This device aims to trigger motor movement every instance of an individual’s heartbeat. For further verification, an LED on both the circuit board and microcontroller will flash when a heartbeat is registered by the microcontroller. 

A Quickstart guide can be found in the uploaded files if you wish to repeat this project!
